### What The Hell is This?
**MetaConfig Settings** are *customizable parameters* within the Instagram app. For this to work, you must have Instagram with *internal settings* or Developer panel enabled. The [com.instagram.developer](https://github.com/iamdeepanshugarg/com.instagram.developer) is a project to provide you with **Developer Options Page** that are only provided to Instagram *employees*. With [com.instagram.developer](https://github.com/iamdeepanshugarg/com.instagram.developer), you can access internal settings and can try out many new features that are in very early stage. However, be cautious—using [com.instagram.developer](https://github.com/iamdeepanshugarg/com.instagram.developer) comes with risks. It *may crash unexpectedly* if you perform weird experiments and could contain vulnerabilities or bugs. For regular use, it’s recommended to stick with the Official [com.instagram.android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android) app available on the **Google Play Store**.
`com.instagram.developer doesn't support iOS!`

### What The Hell is This? (for normal users)
**MetaConfig Settings** are like the *secret sauce or behind-the-scenes levers* of Instagram app, letting you customize things like an insider. It's like playing Instagram on expert difficulty. 
But here’s the catch—you need to have access to Instagram's *internal settings* to make it work. The [com.instagram.developer](https://github.com/iamdeepanshugarg/com.instagram.developer) enables the **Developer Options Page** for you, normally reserved for Instagram’s *employees*. 
If you’re feeling adventurous, go for it, but beware: one wrong click and your app could explode. Plus, it could be riddled with bugs and vulnerabilities because, well, it’s not exactly built for prime time. For a *crash-free life*, stick with the OG [com.instagram.android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android) from **Google Play Store**.
<br><br>
### How The Hell I Use?
Open Instagram app, the one with *Developer panel enabled*. Long press home tab to activate Developer panel, Go to **Developer Options Page**, Copy-paste specific param from [com.instagram.developer wiki](https://github.com/iamdeepanshugarg/com.instagram.developer/wiki) to **MetaConfig Settings & Overrides** search engine and do override. Close Instagram app or Restart. Look for the change you just made by using the app.
<br><br>
### Why The Hell I do not see Developer panel?
Instagram app ([com.instagram.android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android)) installed from **Google Play Store** is *ready-for-public* and have Developer panel disabled. Download Instagram ([com.instagram.developer](https://github.com/iamdeepanshugarg/com.instagram.developer)) that has Developer panel enabled by me from Releases. Download the *most recent Release*.
<br><br>
### Advise for Modded APKs
**Modded APKs** are *unofficial modified versions* of the original Instagram application created by *third-party developers* who alter the original app to include features (iOS, themes, interface customization or additional) or remove restrictions that are not available in the Official Instagram app. It may contain *third-party ads or links*, *malware*, or *spyware* and can potentially *harvest personal data*, including *login credentials*. [com.instagram.developer](https://github.com/iamdeepanshugarg/com.instagram.developer) comes with *no modification* other than raw developer tools, enhancing your privacy and security. But, Original [com.instagram.android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android) installed from **Google Play Store** will always be the most secured.
